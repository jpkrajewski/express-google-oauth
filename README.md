### Authentication System with Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL
This project is a full-featured authentication system built using Node.js, Express, Passport.js, and PostgreSQL. It supports local authentication, as well as OAuth login with Google, and includes routes for user registration, login, and protected access to content. It demonstrates skills in backend development, database integration, and secure password handling.

### Features
- Local Authentication: Users can register and log in using email and password.
- OAuth Integration: Google OAuth2 is integrated to provide social login functionality.
- Session Management: Sessions are securely managed using express-session.
- Protected Routes: Access to certain routes requires users to be authenticated.
- Database Interaction: Uses PostgreSQL to securely store user credentials and data.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling with proper logging in both routes and async functions.
### Technologies
- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
- Authentication: Passport.js with both local and Google OAuth strategies
- Database: PostgreSQL for user data storage
- Password Encryption: bcrypt for hashing and comparing passwords
- Environment Management: dotenv for managing environment variables
